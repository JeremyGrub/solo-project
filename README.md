# solo-project
My solo project called Ask Winston

I chose to build this for my solo project, because whenever I get asked what I want for dinner, I also rewspond with IDK or I don't care.
My fiance hates this!
This program will allow me (and users) to add differnt restaurants to the database.
Winston (our dog) will then choose a random option from the database and display it for you.
You can then choose to eat there or ask him again.
When you choose to eat there, it will be tracked and displayed in the table. that way you can see how many times each place is chosen.

I have plans to implement more ideas and make it more public friendly.
